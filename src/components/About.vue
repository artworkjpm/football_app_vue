    <h4 class="mt-4">About this app</h4>
    <div>
      <p>I made this app due to my love for Football, mostly linked to Arsenal FC and the English Premier League, and my fascination into creating a league table using my Front End skills. I've been viewing league tables all my grown up life and wanted to make one myself.</p>

      <p>
        This app obtains data from a free service called
        <a
          href="https://www.football-data.org/"
          target="_blank"
        >https://www.football-data.org/</a> and with the Football industry being so money centric, there are limitations to this free service.
        <strong>The biggest limitation being the user can only make 9 calls a minute to their API.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Therefore, if you click around the tabs and teams more than 9 times in one minute, you'll likely get no loaded data.</p>
